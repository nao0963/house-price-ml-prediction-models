# Raw Data Directory

This directory contains the original, unprocessed datasets:

## Files
- `train.csv` - Original Ames Housing dataset with target variable (SalePrice)
- `train.csv.gz` - Compressed version of the training data

## Usage
These raw files should not be modified directly. Use them as the source for data preprocessing and feature engineering in the notebooks. All processed datasets are stored in the `../processed/` directory.
